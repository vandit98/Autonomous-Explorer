# Welcome to Autonomous Explorer

#### What is Autonomous Explorer?
Autonomous Explorer is a project that involves building a rover that can autonomously explore its environment and reach its destination using Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques. The project uses ReactJS and ThreeJS for the frontend and FastAPI for backend integration.

Neat cars allows you to draw a track, choose a starting point and watch the magic happen: the cars will drive themselves and constantly improve their driving skills.

You will also be able to observe the Artificial Neural Network of the best car from the generation.

This web aplication and the reinforcement learning model has been submitted as a part of the final presentation given by our team ([Vandit Tyagi](https://github.com/vandit98)and [Gautam Sarawagi](https://github.com/gautamsarawagi)) in the country's first, one of a  unique Hackathon - _**HackTheChain**

<h3> Setting Up the Project </h3>

For running the application in your local web server:
* At first you must have the python,node js and yarn installed.
* Now clone the repository using the command git clone https://github.com/vandit98/Autonomous-Explorer.
* Open the Autonomous-Explorer folder.
* This website folder consists of two parts [frontend](https://github.com/vandit98/Autonomous-Explorer/tree/main/frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/vandit98/Autonomous-Explorer/tree/main/backend)
* Open the backend folder and type <b>uvicorn main_fastapi:app</b> in the terminal. Your backend server will start.
* Now open the frontend folder and type <b>yarn</b> in the terminal.Now to start the frontend server write <b>yarn dev</b>
*You can see your website being running on [localhost:5713](http://localhost:5713)
